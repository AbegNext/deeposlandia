Exploiting artificial intelligence within the geospatial data context tends to
be easier and easier thanks to emerging AI techniques. Neural networks take
indeed various kind of designs, and cope with a wide range of applications.

At [[http://oslandia.com/en/home-en/][Oslandia]] we bet that these techniques will have an added-value in our daily
activity, as data is of first importance for us.

This article will show you an example of how to use AI techniques so as to
address typical use cases.

* Exploit an open dataset related to street-scene

In this article we use a set of images provided by [[https://www.mapillary.com/][Mapillary]], in order to
investigate on the presence of some typical street-scene objects (vehicles,
roads, pedestrians...). Mapillary released this dataset recently, it is [[https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas][still
available on its website]] and may be downloaded freely for a research purpose.

As inputs, Mapillary provides a bunch of street scene images of various sizes
in a =images= repository, and the same images after filtering process in
=instances= and =labels= repositories. The latter is crucial, as the filtered
images are actually composed of pixels in a reduced set of colors. Actually,
there is one color per object types; and 66 object types in total.

#+NAME:   fig:ex_mapillary_image
#+ATTR_HTML: width="30px"
[[../images/MVD_M2kh294N9c72sICO990Uew.png]]

There are 18,000 images in the training set, 2,000 images in the validation set,
and 5,000 images in the testing set.

** Comment about the image sizes

For all images (train, validation, test), labels (train, validation) and
instances (train, validation), images are resized according to a single
reference size. As a remark, in the validation dataset, most images seem to be
such as =height= is equal to =0.75*width=; and image sizes are comprised
between =600*800= and =3752*5376=, as shown below.

#+CAPTION: Mapillary image sizes
#+NAME:   fig:ex_mapillary_image_sizes
#+ATTR_HTML: width="30px"
[[../images/mapillary_image_sizes.png]]

Neural networks consider equally-sized inputs. A first approximation could be
to resize every image as the most encountered size (=2448*3264=), however we
choose to resize them at a smaller size (=576*768=) for computation purpose.

** Transform the labelled image into output data

Filtered versions are available for training and validation images. Some minor
operations on the image pixels can give outputs as one-hot vectors (/i.e./ a
vector of =0= and =1=, =1= when the corresponding label is on the image, =0=
otherwise).

By gathering every images, two 2D-arrays are built, respectively of shapes
[18000, 66] and [2000, 66] (as a reminder, there are 66 object types within the
Mapillary classification).

* Implement a convolutional neural network with TensorFlow

Our goal here is to predict the presence of differents street-scene components
on pictures. We aim to train a neural network model to make it able to detect
if there is one (or more) car(s), truck(s) or bicycle(s), for instance, on test
images.

As Mapillary provided a set of 66 labels and a labelled version of each
training and validation image dataset, we plan to investigate a multilabel
classification problem, where the final network layer must evaluate if there is
an occurrence of each label on any image. As a consequence, =y_true= and
=y_pred= will be vectors of size 66 composed of zeros and ones.

#+RESULTS:

** Neural network global structure

Handling image within neural network is generally done with the help of
*convolutional neural network*. They are composed of several kind of layers
that must be described:

+ some convolutional layers, in which images are filtered by several learnable
  image kernels, so as to extract image patterns based on pixels (this layer
  type is very important in convolutional neural network);
+ some pooling layers, in order to reduce the size of images and converge
  towards output layer, as well as to extract feature rough locations (the =max=
  pooling operation is the most common one, /i.e./ consider the maximal value
  over a local set of pixels);
+ some fully-connected layers, where every neurons of the current layer are
  connected to every neurons of the previous layer.

We've carried out a set of tests with different hyperparameter values, /i.e./
different amounts of each layer kinds. The results are globally stable if we
consider more than one convolutional layer. Here comes the way to define a
neural network with [[https://www.tensorflow.org/][TensorFlow]], the dedicated Python library.

# dag : ça fonctionne 'import sources.' même si y'a pas de =__init__.py= dans ton
# répertoire ?

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports none
import sources.cnn_layers as cnnl

train_image_batch, train_label_batch, train_filename_batch = \
cnnl.prepare_data(576, 768, 3, 20, "training", "training_data_pipe")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** How to define data

Inputs and outputs are defined as "placeholders", /aka/ a sort of variables
that must be feed by data.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
X = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 576, 768, 3], name='X')
Y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 66], name='Y')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** How to define a convolutional layer

After designing the kernel and the biases, we can use the TensorFlow function
=conv2d= to build this layer.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
kernel1 = tf.get_variable('kernel1',
                         [8, 8, 3, 16],
                         initializer=tf.truncated_normal_initializer())
biases1 = tf.get_variable('biases1',
                         [16],
                         initializer=tf.constant_initializer(0.0))
# Apply the image convolution with a ReLu activation function
conv_layer1 = tf.nn.relu(tf.add(tf.nn.conv2d(X, kernel1, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME"), biases1))
#+END_SRC

In this example, the kernel are 16 squares of 8*8 pixels considering 3 colors
(RGB channels).

#+RESULTS:

** How to define a max-pooling layer

As for convolutional layer, there is a ready-to-use function in the TensorFlow API,
/i.e./ =max_pool=.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
pool_layer1 = tf.nn.max_pool(conv_layer1, ksize=[1, 4, 4, 1], strides=[1, 4, 4, 1], padding='SAME')
#+END_SRC

This function takes the maximal pixel value for each block of 4*4 pixels, in
every filtered image. The out-of-the-border pixels are set as the border
pixels, if a block definition needs such additional information. The number of
pixels is divided by 16 after such an operation.

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports none
kernel2 = tf.get_variable('kernel2',
                         [8, 8, 16, 24],
                         initializer=tf.truncated_normal_initializer())
biases2 = tf.get_variable('biases2',
                         [24],
                         initializer=tf.constant_initializer(0.0))
# Apply the image convolution with a ReLu activation function
conv_layer2 = tf.nn.relu(tf.add(tf.nn.conv2d(pool_layer1, kernel2, strides=[1, 1, 1, 1], padding="SAME"), biases2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports none
pool_layer2 = tf.nn.max_pool(conv_layer2, ksize=[1, 4, 4, 1], strides=[1, 4, 4, 1], padding='SAME')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** How to define a fully-connected layer

This operation corresponds to a standard matrix multiplication; we just have to
reshape the output of the previous layer so as to consider comparable
structures. Let's imagine we add a second convolutional layer as well as second
max-pooling layer, the full-connected layer definition is as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
reshaped = tf.reshape(pool_layer2, [-1, int((576/(4*4))*(768/(4*4))*24)])
# Create weights and biases
weights_fc = tf.get_variable('weights_fullconn', [int((576/(4*4))*(768/(4*4))*24), 1024],
                    initializer=tf.truncated_normal_initializer())
biases_fc = tf.get_variable('biases_fullconn', [1024],
                    initializer=tf.constant_initializer(0.0))
# Apply relu on matmul of reshaped and w + b
fc = tf.nn.relu(tf.add(tf.matmul(reshaped, weights_fc), biases_fc), name='relu')
# Apply dropout
fc_layer = tf.nn.dropout(fc, 0.75, name='relu_with_dropout')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Here we have defined the major part of our network. However the output layer is
still missing...

** Build predicted labels

The predicted labels are given after a sigmoid activation in the last layer:
even if other performing activation functions exist, the sigmoid function
allows to consider independant probabilities in multilabel context, /i.e./ the
presence of different object types on images is possible.

The sigmoid function gives probabilities of appearance of each object type, for
a given picture. The predicted labels are built as simply as possible: a
threshold of =0.5= is set to differentiate negative and positive predictions.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
# Create weights and biases for the final fully-connected layer
weights_sig = tf.get_variable('weights_s', [1024, 66],
                    initializer=tf.truncated_normal_initializer())
biases_sig = tf.get_variable('biases_s', [66],
                    initializer=tf.random_normal_initializer())
logits = tf.add(tf.matmul(fc_layer, weights_sig), biases_sig)
Y_raw_predict = tf.nn.sigmoid(logits)
Y_predict = tf.to_int32(tf.round(Y_raw_predict))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Optimize the network

Although several metrics may measure the model convergence, we choose to
consider classic cross-entropy between true and predicted labels.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
entropy = tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=Y, logits=logits)
loss = tf.reduce_mean(entropy, name="loss")
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(0.01).minimize(loss)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

In this snippet, we are using =AdamOptimizer=, however other solutions do exist
(/e.g./ =GradientDescentOptimizer=).

** Assess the model quality

Several way of measuring the model quality may be computed:

+ the total accuracy (number of good predictions, over total number of
  predictions)
+ the accuracy per label
+ the total precision (number of true positives over all positive predictions)
+ the precision per label
+ the total recall (number of true positives over all real positive values)
+ the recall per label

** Train the model

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

def unnest(l):
    return [index for sublist in l for index in sublist]

sess = tf.Session()
# Initialize the tensorflow variables
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
    
# Initialize threads to begin batching operations
coord = tf.train.Coordinator()
threads = tf.train.start_queue_runners(coord=coord, sess=sess)
    
# Train the model
for index in range(20):
    X_batch, Y_batch = sess.run([train_image_batch, train_label_batch])
    sess.run(optimizer, feed_dict={X: X_batch, Y: Y_batch})
    if index % 5 == 0:
        Y_pred, loss_batch = sess.run([Y_predict, loss], feed_dict={X: X_batch, Y: Y_batch})
        accuracy_batch = accuracy_score(unnest(Y_batch), unnest(Y_pred))
        print("""Step {}: loss = {:5.3f}, accuracy={:1.3f}""".format(index, loss_batch, accuracy_batch))
    
# Stop the threads used during the process
coord.request_stop()
coord.join(threads)

#+RESULTS:

* What kind of objects are on a test image ?

In order to illstrate the previous sections, we can test our network on a new
image, /i.e./ an image that does not have been scanned during model training.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports code
Y_pred, loss_batch = sess.run([Y_predict, loss], feed_dict={X: x_test, Y: y_test})
sess.close()
Y_pred[0]
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports none
y_test[0]
#+END_SRC:

#+RESULTS:

By comparing the output given by the model and the true output, we can assess
the model accuracy. In this case, we focus on the confusion matrix:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports results
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

pd.DataFrame(confusion_matrix(y_test[0], Y_pred[0]), columns=["Y_pred=False", "Y_pred=True"], index=["y_test=False", "y_test=True"])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:               Y_pred=False  Y_pred=True
: y_test=False            35            8
: y_test=True             10           13

The model accuracy for this image is around =72.7% ((35+13)/66)=, which is not
so good. However it may be improved as the model was trained only on a small
part of images...

We can extract the label that are maybe the more interesting category, /aka/
the /true positives/ corresponding to object on the image detected by the
model:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports results
import itertools

true_positive = list(itertools.compress(label_names, np.logical_and(y_test[0], Y_pred[0])))
pd.Series(true_positive)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
0              wall
1           parking
2              road
3          building
4        vegetation
5         billboard
6      street-light
7              pole
8      utility-pole
9     traffic-light
10            front
11              car
12        unlabeled
dtype: object
#+end_example

On the same manner, we have the /false positives/, /i.e./ when the model say
=yes= on absent labels:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports results
false_positive = list(itertools.compress(label_names, np.logical_and(np.logical_not(y_test[0]), Y_pred[0])))
pd.Series(false_positive)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0            bird
: 1       bike-lane
: 2          bridge
: 3       bicyclist
: 4     other-rider
: 5         manhole
: 6            boat
: 7    wheeled-slow
: dtype: object

Then a focus may be done on /false negatives/, wrongly labelled as =False= by
the model, as they are on the picture:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports results
false_negative = list(itertools.compress(label_names, np.logical_and(y_test[0], np.logical_not(Y_pred[0]))))
pd.Series(false_negative)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
0           curb
1          fence
2       curb-cut

7    cctv-camera
8           back
9          truck
dtype: object
#+end_example

And finally, we can extract the label that are not on the picture, and that
were marked as absent by the model (/true negatives/). As they are more
example, we only list some examples:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session mapcnn :exports results
true_negative = list(itertools.compress(label_names, np.logical_and(np.logical_not(y_test[0]), np.logical_not(Y_pred[0]))))
pd.Series(true_negative).sample(6)

* How to go further?

In this post we've just considered a feature detection problem, so as to decide
if an object type =t= is really on an image =p=, or not. The natural
prolongation of that is the semantic segmentation, /i.e./ knowing which
pixel(s) of =p= have to be labeled as part of an object of type =t=.

This is the way Mapillary labelled the pictures; it is without any doubt a
really promising research field for some use cases related to geospatial data!
