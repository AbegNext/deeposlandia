<h4>Description</h4>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mapillary.com/dataset/vistas">Mapillary</a>
dataset, there are 65 labels, and consequently the model aims at answering one
question for each: <em>is this label on the picture?</em> We get as a result a
vector of 65 boolean values.</p>

<p>The dataset glossary is subdivided into 7 larger classes. In order to take
  advantage of this point, a lighter classification with only 11 labels has
  been built up:
  <ul>
    <li>animal: ground animal or birds</li>
    <li>construction (barrier): curbs, fences, guard rails and other barriers</li>
    <li>construction (flat): ground areas like roads, parkings, bike lanes...</li>
    <li>construction (structure): buildings, bridges, tunnels</li>
    <li>human</li>
    <li>marking</li>
    <li>nature: mountain, sand, sky, vegetation</li>
    <li>object (traffic): traffic lights and signs</li>
    <li>object (vehicule)</li>
    <li>object: miscellaneous objects</li>
    <li>void: own vehicle or unlabeled pixels</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h4>Remark about model training</h4>

<p>The model used here has been trained during 4 epochs with a set of 18000
training images. It has been validated with a smaller set of 2000 images (the
validation occurred at the end of each training epoch), in order to ensure that
learned features are as generic as possible.</p>

<h4>Use the deep learning model to predict image labels</h4>

<p>Click on the below button to generate a random picture from Mapillary
dataset, and to display the corresponding label predictions.</p>
